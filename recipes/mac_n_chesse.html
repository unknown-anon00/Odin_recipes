Stir until smooth and creamy.</li>

<li><strong>Season</strong>

Add salt, pepper, and any optional spices.</li>

<li><strong>Combine pasta and sauce</strong>

Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce.

Stir until every piece is coated.</li>

<li><strong><em>(Optional)</em> Bake for extra flavor</strong>

Transfer to a baking dish, sprinkle extra cheese and breadcrumbs on top, and bake <em>at 180°C (350°F) for 15–20 minutes until golden and crispy</em></li>
